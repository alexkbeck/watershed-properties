# Watershed Properties

Watershed Properties is a fictional real estate & property management company. This was part of my capstone project for the course Harnessing Data Analytics by Duke University on Coursera.

## Context   

The capstone project included fictional interviews with the Finance Director, Marketing Director, and the Project Manager. From these interviews, I came up with these fundemental question to ask of the data:  

**1. Which of our properties will be clearly profitable (6k+ profit per year) as short-term rentals over the first three years?  
2. What is the change in cash flow and profits for these clearly profitable properties?**

## Tableau dashboard

I queried the database to retrieve the necessary data and created this Tableau dashboard to display my findings: [Link to Tableau Public dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/WatershedDashboard_16068717953980/WatershedDashboard?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Presentation

Based on the findings from the dashboard I created this presentation to communicate my insights to the class: [Link to Google Slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JONmUnqV8Ro7K6EXy82aRFRE2W88rmwY/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116048865080928929054&rtpof=true&sd=true)
